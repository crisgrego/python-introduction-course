# python-introduction-course
These repository keeps track of all the modules I wrote while I was following a python 3.x course of 8 hours to learn the basis of the language. 

I think is a good course and I have learned a lot about this language. It is easy to learn, very fast to write and clean. You don't need to setup an enviroment to use the lastest features like in Nodejs, as soon as you create a .py file you are moving things around, this gives you a power sensation. Although is a language meant for scientific areas, you can made almost anything in it.

Now that I have the feeling coding in this language I can tell that I like it and I will include it in my skillset.
